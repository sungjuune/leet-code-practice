But it had trouble in other cases when submitted!!!(e.g. [1,1], where the list only contains a single integer.) So I figured it was definitely the **while loop problem**. My initial solution did not consider this kind of scenario. Changing the while loop condition into ```while idx+1 < len(nums):``` solved all the problem!\n",
